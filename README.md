## The Fancy Sudoku 

#### Created by Karoly Jonas, Guliaeva Anastasiia and Loboda Liliia.

###### The Fancy Sudoku is a GUI application, written on Java, with three levels of difficulty and two appearance modes: light and dark. 

###### To start a game, one have to press a 'New Game' button and then choose between three levels: easy, medium and hard. The timer starts the time one opened a window of the game. 

###### We used the following programming techniques: 
- Graphical User Interface (aka JavaFX);
- Collections;
- Maven;
- SceneBuilder application;
- Serialization (JSON);
- CSS;
- Custom exceptions;
- Try-catch blocks;
- File I/O;
- Method overriding;
- Lambda expressions;
- Streams;
