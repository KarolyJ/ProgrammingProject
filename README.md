# ProgrammingProject 

## The Fancy Sudoku

Created by `Karoly Jonas`, `Guliaeva Anastasiia` and `Loboda Liliia`.

 **The Fancy Sudoku** is a GUI application, written on **Java**, with three levels of difficulty and two appearance modes: **light** and **dark**.

### Navigation

 * To launch the application, run HelloApplication in the GUI folder.
 * To start a game, one have to press a *'New Game'* button and then choose between three levels: easy, medium and hard. The timer starts the time one opened a window of the game. There is also a coin system that gives you opportunity to buy a life.
 * In *Ranking List* you can check your best time in which you solved the difficulties.
* In the last section there are the *rules* of the game. 

### We used the following programming techniques: 

* Graphical User Interface (aka JavaFX);
* Collections;
* Maven;
* SceneBuilder application;
* Serialization (JSON);
* CSS;
* Custom exceptions;
* Try-catch blocks;
* File I/O;
* Method overriding;
* Lambda expressions;
* Streams;
* JUnit 5.


### How we organized the work 
1) Firstly, `Liliia` and `Jonas` did the logic, while `Anastasiia` was dealing with the front-end part.
2) After a while, the responsibilities of both inner and outter parts got distributed between the members. The ones who did the math of the game at the beginning, did some front-end work and vice versa.
3) Such as approach made us trying new directions of the game development posssible and more diverse.


###  Git 

Our team mostly used the Main branch to store the logic of the game and the GUI parts, etc. At first we created a branch for each goal, but it did not work out, so that we decided to combine everyting under one branch. There is only another branch for the testing. 
### Difficulties 

Besides degubbing, there have been some puzzles to solve during our development journey: 
* Github deleted a few times some of the files, which created issues for us in restoring them.
* We realized that it would be much more difficult to releaze a project that we imagined before.
* It was the first time when we were dealing with the Scenebuilder program and at some points did not undersand how to solve different problems.
