The goal of this game is clear: to fill and complete the grid using the numbers from 1 to 9. &#10;The challenging part lays on the restrictions imposed on the player to be able to fill the grid.&#10;&#10;Rule 1 - Each row must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions.&#10;The player must focus on filling each row of the grid while ensuring there are no duplicated numbers. &#10;The placement order of the digits is irrelevant.&#10; &#10;Every puzzle, regardless of the difficulty level, begins with allocated numbers on the grid. The player &#10;should use these numbers as clues to find which digits are missing in each row.&#10;&#10;Rule 2 - Each column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions&#10;The Sudoku rules for the columns on the grid are exactly the same as for the rows. The player must also fill &#10;these with the numbers from 1 to 9, making sure each digit occurs only once per column.&#10; &#10;The numbers allocated at the beginning of the puzzle work as clues to find which digits are missing in each &#10;column and their position.&#10;&#10;Rule 3 - The digits can only occur once per block (nonet)&#10;A regular 9 x 9 grid is divided into 9 smaller blocks of 3 x 3, also known as nonets. The numbers from 1 to 9 &#10;can only occur once per nonet.&#10; &#10;In practice, this means that the process of filling the rows and columns without duplicated digits finds inside&#10;each block another restriction to the numbersâ€™ positioning.&#10;&#10;Rule 4 - The sum of every single row, column and nonet must equal 45&#10;To find out which numbers are missing from each row, column or block or if there are any duplicates, the &#10;player can simply count or flex their math skills and sum the numbers. When the digits occur only once,&#10; the total of each row, column and group must be of 45.&#10;&#10;1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9= 45" />
